## Natural Language Processing with Classification and Vector Spaces

#### Week1 Vocabulary & Feature Extraction

**Sparse Representation**: 

- Represent Text as a vector. Check every word from vocabulary, if appear, note 1 else 0
- Disadvantage: Large
- Logistric regression learn **N+1** where N is the size of vocabulary
- Build vocabulary: process one by one and get sets of lists of word


```
e.g. I am happy because I am learning NLP

[I, am, happy, because, learning NLP, ... hated, the, movie]
 1   1   1       1         1       1        0     0     0

```

**Positive & Negative Frequencies**: Build vocabulary, map word to frequencey

Hence you end up getting the following feature vector ```[1,8,11][1,8,11]```. 11 corresponds to the bias, 88 the positive feature, and 1111 the negative feature.


**Preprocessing**: 

When preprocessing, you have to perform the following:

1. Eliminate handles(@...) and URLs
2. Tokenize the string into words.
3. Remove stop words like  “and, is, are, at, has, for ,a”
4. Stemming- or convert every word to its stem. Like dancer, dancing, danced, becomes 'danc'. You can use porter stemmer to take care of this.
5. Convert all your words to lower case.

matrix with m rows and three columns. Every row: the feature for each tweets

**General Implementation**: 

```python
freqs = build_freqs(tweets,labels) #Build frequencies dictionary
X = np.zeros((m,3)) #Initialize matrix X
for i in range(m): #For every tweet
    p_tweet = process_tweet(tweets[i]) #process tweet, include
                                      # deleting stops, stemming, deleting URLS, and handles and lower cases
    X[i, :] = extract_features(p_tweet, freqs) #Extract Features: 
                                               #By summing up the positive and negative frequencies of the tweets
                                               
```

**Logistic Regression**

$$x^{\left( i \right)} $$ is i-th tweet

**Logistic Cost Function Derivation**

$$P\left( y \mid x^{\left( i \right)}, \theta \right) = h \left(x^{\left( i \right)}, \theta \right)^{y^\left( i \right)} \left( 1-  h \left(x^{\left( i \right)}, \theta \right) \right)^{\left( 1- y^\left( i \right) \right)} $$

when y = 1, you get $$h \left(x^{\left( i \right)}, \theta \right)$$, when y = 0, you get $$ \left( 1-  h \left(x^{\left( i \right)}, \theta \right) \right) $$. In either case, you want to maximize $$ h \left(x^{\left( i \right)}, \theta \right)$$ clsoe to 1. when y = 0, you want $$ \left( 1-  h \left(x^{\left( i \right)}, \theta \right) $$ to be 0  as $$ h \left(x^{\left( i \right)}, \theta \right)$$ close to 1, when y = 1, you want $$ h \left(x^{\left( i \right)}, \theta \right) = 1$$

Define the likelihood as 

$$L\left(  \theta \right) = \prod_{i=1}^{m}  h \left(\theta, x^{\left( i \right)} \right)^{y^\left( i \right)} \left( 1-  h \left(\theta, x^{\left( i \right)} \right) \right)^{\left( 1- y^\left( i \right) \right)}   $$
